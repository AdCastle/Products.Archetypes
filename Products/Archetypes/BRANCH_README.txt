This branch contains minor modifications to AT 1.4 which, in case of bitrot, may
be easier to resurrect by looking at branch.diff versus doing a full merge.

Modifications in this branch are in support of work to make Plone3 collapsible
fieldsets available to Plone 2.5:

  https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/fieldsets/trunk/README.txt

Best!
