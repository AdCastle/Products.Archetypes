   [tiran]

   [ajung, tiran]
      
 * Applied patch from [ 997044 ] db_encoding parameter is lost
   in BaseSQLStorage.set
   [biza, tiran]

   usefull to test fields and widgets.
   [tiran]

 * Applied [ 974846 ] Patch for bug #944343 inandout/picklist values
   not sticky to make picklist and inandout compatible with reference
   field again.
   [alecacct, tiran]

 * Reenabled Ben's reference graph tool by removing some stalled testing code
   [tiran]

 * Support unqualified references in reference graph tool
   [bcsaller]
   
 * Added a test for mimetypes registry before adapter call in BaseUnit.update()
   with a more verbose error in the case the user hasn't updated MTR properly.
   [tiran]

 * Fixed Find Objects of uid catalog and reference catalog: Use the relative 
   path (relative to the portal) of the object as uid instead of the full 
   physical path
   [tiran]

 * Added Rebuild Catalog tab to uid catalog and reference catalog to make the 
   life easier
   [tiran]

 * Added context to the PortalTransform.convertTo() call in BaseUnit.transform()
   [tiran]

 * Don't fail to install a product which doesn't have any types
   [spamsch]

 * Catch Unauthorized exception in ExtensibleMetadata.allowDiscussion that could
   be raised by the discussion tool when the authenticated users hasn't 
   ModifyPortalContent permissions.
   [tiran]

 * Added IUIDCatalog and IReferenceCatalog interface. Test for interfaces in
   the installation process of Archetypes to remove invalid catalogs.
   [tiran]

 * Added a check to Field._Vocabulary: A result from portal catalog must be a
   result from uid catalog, too.
   [ender]
   
 * FileField/ImageField: Make sure we always get a wrapped object in content_class
   [tiran]
   
 * ImageField: Fixed getScale/getSize methods, added tag() method
   [tiran]

 * session_save_form was using direct attr access in UT
   code you must use Schema accessor so schema has a 
   security context
   REMEMBER: <BradB> "Free as in Free Iraq"
   [runyaga]

 * issue a warning if they register 2 classes with the
   same name in the same project.  this will happen on
   startup.
   [runyaga]

 * do not assume templates have title_or_id attribute
   [runyaga]

 * Added kernel_make_uuid which is using /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuids as source
   for unique ids. Thx to Ben for this cool idea. :)
   The kernel uuid generator is actually a tiny bit slower than our uuid
   generator but it should be safer if you are worried about the uniqueness of
   uuids.
   [bcsaller, tiran]

 * Fixed [ 1002481 ] Missing i18n: <any>, added at_search_any msgid.
   [tiran]
   
1.3.0-beta4 - 2004-07-09
========================

 * Fix bug on image deletion [clebeaupin]

 * Fixed [ 997899 ] 1.3b3 will ot startup on Zope 2.7, Windows.
   Removed api helper to avoid problem with windows [dreamcatcher, tiran]

 * Small improvements on migration (using aq_base() instead of attribute, using
   is None test instead of simple bool test)
   [tiran]

 * Get the first non None object instead of the first element of a list of
   brains to circumvent problems with stalled objects inside the uid catalog
   [tiran]

 * Don't raise AttributeError when no reference can be found
   [gotcha]

 * Fixed a problem introduced by getRaw method on ReferenceField class.
   When using a field on 'hidden' mode, field.pt uses field.edit_acessor
   to get field value (and edit_accessor calls getRaw).
   The problem was related to ReferenceFields not multivalued where
   getRaw always returns a list, instead of the single UID.
   [deo]

 * Added a flag refresh_references to Archetypes.Extensions.utils.installTypes
   (default False). When enabled it's using ZopeFindAndApply to find all
   objects of the given types and refreshes their references. This is a 
   workaround but not a real fix for bug 997840.
   [tiran]

 * Added a test for at_version information
   [tiran]

 * Support Pdata (possible large data from OFS.Image) as type for FileField.
   This is required to load large images and files based on OFS.Image into a 
   FileField.
   [tiran]

 * Merged sid's security branch. DefaultLayer based classes (Field, Widget) and 
   schema are now subclassed from ExtensionsClass.Base.
   [dreamcatcher, tiran]

 * Fixed [ 994511 ] Field.py: Vocabulary cannot handle 2-tuple list
   [tiran]

 * Fixed creation_date field to be metadata again 
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 944440 ] getMsgID method of DisplayList should be used 
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 972091 ] base widget doesn't support visble attribute for view 
  [tiran]

 * Added better traceback information to fixAfterRenameType
   [tiran]

 * Fixed [ 988898 ] Don't swallow ConflictError (SQL missing)
   [tiran]
