1.3.0-beta4 - 2004-07-09
========================

 * Fix bug on image deletion [clebeaupin]

 * Fixed [ 997899 ] 1.3b3 will ot startup on Zope 2.7, Windows.
   Removed api helper to avoid problem with windows [dreamcatcher, tiran]

 * Small improvements on migration (using aq_base() instead of attribute, using
   is None test instead of simple bool test)
   [tiran]

 * Get the first non None object instead of the first element of a list of
   brains to circumvent problems with stalled objects inside the uid catalog
   [tiran]

 * Don't raise AttributeError when no reference can be found
   [gotcha]

 * Fixed a problem introduced by getRaw method on ReferenceField class.
   When using a field on 'hidden' mode, field.pt uses field.edit_acessor
   to get field value (and edit_accessor calls getRaw).
   The problem was related to ReferenceFields not multivalued where
   getRaw always returns a list, instead of the single UID.
   [deo]

 * Added a flag refresh_references to Archetypes.Extensions.utils.installTypes
   (default False). When enabled it's using ZopeFindAndApply to find all
   objects of the given types and refreshes their references. This is a 
   workaround but not a real fix for bug 997840.
   [tiran]

 * Added a test for at_version information
   [tiran]

   schema are now subclassed from ExtensionsClass.Base.
