generator
=========

Widget generator package, originally designed for Archetypes but usable as a 
standalone package.


Installation
------------

* Extract the tarball 


EITHER:

* Add it to you Zope Products Directory. As of Archetypes 1.2.5+ and Archetypes
  1.3 the generator and validator packages are expected to be installed as Zope
  Products, not Python Packages.

OR:

* Run "python setup.py install". See "python setup.py install  --help" for
installation options. If you have multiple python installations and use  
Archetypes, be sure to install this product in an accessible place for the 
python interpreter used by Zope.

* That's it, you should have the library installed.
