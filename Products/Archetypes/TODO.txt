at the moment unit tests are only running on Zope 2.7.x, Plone 2.0.5

theres one failing trst at Zope 2.7.6, Plone 2.1 bundle (with CMF 1.5)

running unit tests o Zope 2.8, Plone 2.1 bundle is like watching the hell,
loads of errors produced from zope, and some failing tests, mostly together
with SQL related tasks.
