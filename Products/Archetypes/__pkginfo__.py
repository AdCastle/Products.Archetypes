     Formerly known as CMFTypes, Archetypes is a developers framework
     for rapidly developing and deploying rich, full featured content
     types within the context of Zope/CMF and Plone.
.
     Archetypes is based around the idea of an _Active Schema_. Rather
     than provide a simple description of a new data type Archetype
     schemas do the actual work and heavy lifting involved in using
     the new type. Archetype Schemas serve as easy extension points
     for other developers as project specific components can be
     created and bound or you can choose among the rich existing set
     of features.
.
Features
    * Simple schemas with working default policy.
    * Power and flexibility with lowered incidental complexity.
    * Integration with rich content sources such as Office Product Suites.
    * Full automatic form generation
