Description: A developers framework for rapidly developing and deploying rich, full featured content types within the context of Zope/CMF and Plone
 Archetypes
 Formerly known as CMFTypes, Archetypes is a developers framework
 for rapidly developing and deploying rich, full featured content
 types within the context of Zope/CMF and Plone.
 .
 Archetypes is based around the idea of an _Active Schema_. Rather
 than provide a simple description of a new data type Archetype
 schemas do the actual work and heavy lifting involved in using
 the new type. Archetype Schemas serve as easy extension points
 for other developers as project specific components can be
 created and bound or you can choose among the rich existing set
 of features.
 .
 Features
 * Simple schemas with working default policy.
 * Power and flexibility with lowered incidental complexity.
 * Integration with rich content sources such as Office Product Suites.
 * Full automatic form generation
 * i18n content on a field basis
