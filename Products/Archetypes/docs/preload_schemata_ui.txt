USING PRELOADED SCHEMATA LAYERS
-------------------------------

There is now an alternative view of schematas. They are not separate pages anymore but
all in one page but only one schemata visible at once. One can instantly switch between
these schematas without reloading the page (use of DHTML).

In order to switch this on, add the following line as class variable to your class:

USE_PRELOAD_SCHEMATA_UI=1

You then get the DHTML version of schemata.

implementation note:

    Added files preload_edit_macros.pt (changed copy of edit_macros) and getFieldsetInfo.py
    (for collecting information). base_edit.pt changed to select it depending on the class var.
