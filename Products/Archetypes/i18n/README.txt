Hi.

Archetypes is using two domains: plone and archetypes.

The file in Archetypes is for the archetypes domain, the file in 
PloneTranslations for plone domain.

AFAIK we don't use any of the translations in archetypes domain for now, 
so it should be sufficient to translate the file in PloneTranslations to 
get a complete french Plone 2.1 translation.

I'll take care of this after Plone 2.1 by changing Archetypes to use 
it's own domain and rely only on those msgid's of Plone which actually 
exists in Plone.

Best regards,
Hanno
